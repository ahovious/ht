    <h1>Humanizing <b>Technology</b></h1>

      <h2>The Topic.</h2>
      <p>
        In this course, we will investigate and experiment with both conceptual and applied efforts
        to humanize technology, especially computer technology. We will question the goals of
        <em>humanization</em> and its relationship to concepts such as design ethics and
        user-centered and emotional design. While the focus of the class will be on computer
        technology and programming languages, we will also look at humanization with regard to
        technologically rich areas such as industrial design and engineering, architecture and
        the built environment, and nanotechnologies.

        <h2>The Projects.</h2>
        <p>
          Students will complete applied projects but should also expect to write regularly and
          extensively about course topics. Possible projects include participation in an open-source
          design/development project, creating a Web application, or proposing and possibly
          executing the redesign of a problem technology. In any project, students will be expected
          to extend and redefine it to meet their own interests and goals.
        </p>

        <h2>The Classes and Technology.</h2>
        <p>
          Classes will be held in a computer lab maintained by Professor Stolley in Galvin Library.
          Class time will be divided between structured discussion and active use of the
          Linux-based computers in the lab for project work and shorter, class-length demonstrations
          and exploratory activities. Students will talking and doing, making and testing.
          <b>The instructor will not be lecturing in this course.</b> Come ready to actively learn.
