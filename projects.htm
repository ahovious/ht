        <h2>Ongoing Project</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Blogging (20pts)</b> You are going to blog this course, using your blogging platform of choice (e.g., WordPress, Tumblr, Posterous). You may opt to keep your blog private (though you must, of course, give access to the instructor). Be sure to make sure that the blogging platform you choose (or self-host) enables restricted access, if that is a concern to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may post about anything that you like, as often as you’d like, so long as 1) it’s in some way related to the course and 2) you’re posting in the neighborhood of 500 words a week (1000 words for COM580). Because of privacy matters relating to FERPA, do not blog about other students in the class, even if you keep your blog private.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least one post per week should be about the <cite>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</cite> book for the weeks that you are reading and working through it (see the <a href="index.htm">Calendar</a>). Tracking and reflecting on your own research and learning is a key goal of this course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: if one of our reading discussions in class is not as active or lively as it should be, you may be called upon to read aloud one of your blog entries from the week leading up to that class. Therefore, think about your blogging activity as a way to get fired up about talking with others about the course work and topics.

        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Communicating Technology (25pts)</b>. For this project, you will write about some issue
          related to humanizing technology for a specific technology publication (think: Wired, Read
          Write Web, Mashable, etc.). You will have to research your topic, and present an argument.
          And because you’re writing about technology, keep in mind that “writing” can be as much
          image, video, and sound as it is standard text-based writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will begin this project by finding three Web-available pieces of technology writing
          that you find compelling because of how they are written. (In class on 1/17, we will have
          a discussion of what makes for ‘compelling’ technology writing, and add that list here.)
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also need to establish a topic to write about; we will talk about specific
          strategies for that in class, but the topic should be something that you are eager to
          research--rather than something you could write from your pool of expertise. You can write about a specific device (though you should have access to it), a language, a design method, a particular technological/design phenomenon, or anything else that you find intriguing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the piece that you write should engage a broad public. It should not, in other words, be written for an audience of hardcore tech-heads (nor should it be written for a group of second-graders). (In class on 1/17, we’ll talk a bit about audience regarding the Jacobson interview on Fresh Air.)
        </p>
        <p>Deliverables:</p>
        <ol class="instructions">
          <li>Three compelling pieces of Web-available technology writing (email links to instructor by January 24)</li>
          <li>Draft of your project (emailed as a link to your blog or as an attachment to instructor by January 31)</li>
          <li>Final project presentation (max 7 minutes) on February 14</li>
          <li>Final project (emailed as link to your blog or as an attachment to instructor by
          the start of class on February 14)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <p><b>Humanistic Design/Redesign (25pts)</b> (Full description coming February 7). Working in teams lead by a graduate student who will serve as a mentor/guide as well as a collaborator, you will work to design or redesign a technology that solves some particular problem for some specific group of people. This might be an interface, a physical object, or an entire web application; it’s up to your group to propose a specific project.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Project 3</h2>
        <p><b>Position Statement on Humanizing Technology (10pts)</b> (Full description coming February 7) For this project, working alone or in small groups, you will create some kind of position statement on humanizing technology. This could take the form of a position statement on behalf of a group to which you belong at school, work, or in your personal life; or it could be a personal manifesto of sorts, articulating your views on the design, implementation, and/or use of technology. However, it should not just be a simple document; the statement should enact, technologically, the values your statement articulates. For example, if your statement calls for beautifully designed interfaces, you should create it as a beautifuly designed interface.</p>
